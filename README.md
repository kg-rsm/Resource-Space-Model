# Resource-Space-Model
The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a semantic model for organizing, specifying and managing the contents of various resources from multiple dimensions proposed by Professor Hai Zhuge in 2004. It supports abstraction and specialization on resources. The RSM was proposed to facilitate reasonable storage management resources and to efficiently and quickly retrieval resources.

1. **The Web Resource Space Model**  

    Abstract: Classification is a method of efficiently managing various resources. It is also a basic method for human beings to know the real world and synthesize experience. A Web Resource Space Model (in simple RSM) is a semantic data model for specifying, storing, managing and locating Web resources by appropriately classifying the contents of resources. It enables users or applications to operate resources by the SQL-like query language. A Web resource space is a multi-dimensional classification space where dimensions are discrete. Its intrinsic characteristics are worth studying as it is not an ordinary distance space. A resource space can be normalized to increase the correctness of resource management by setting constraints on dimensions.
