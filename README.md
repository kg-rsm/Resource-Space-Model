# Resource-Space-Model
The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a semantic model for organizing, specifying and managing the contents of various resources from multiple dimensions proposed by Professor Hai Zhuge in 2004. It supports abstraction and specialization on resources. The RSM was proposed to facilitate reasonable storage management resources and to efficiently and quickly retrieval resources.
