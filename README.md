# Resource-Space-Model
The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a semantic model for organizing, specifying and managing the contents of various resources from multiple dimensions proposed by Professor Hai Zhuge in 2004. It supports abstraction and specialization on resources. The RSM was proposed to facilitate reasonable storage management resources and to efficiently and quickly retrieval resources.

1. **The Web Resource Space Model**  

    Abstract: Classifying objects into categories at different granularity levels, establishing links between known objects, and discovering clues between known and unknown objects are essential for new-generation semantic data models. This book introduces the Resource Space Model (RSM), which effectively organizes and correctly manages resources by normalizing classification semantics.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Summarization in Cyber-Physical Society**  

    Abstract: Text summarization has been studied for over a half century, but traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding. Automatic summarization is a desirable technique for processing big data. This reference summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional category space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies dimensions on representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism. Investigation extends to incorporating pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and converges to a general summarization method. Further, some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex cyber-physical-social space. Finally, a creative summarization mechanism is proposed as an effort toward the creative summarization of things, which is an open process of interactions among physical objects, data, people, and systems in cyber-physical-social space through a multi-dimensional lens of semantic computing. The author’s insights can inspire research and development of many computing areas.

1. **Resource Space Model, Its Design Method and Applications**

    Abstract: A resource space model (RSM) is a model for specifying, sharing and managing versatile Web resources with a universal resource view. A normal resource space is a semantic coordinate system with independent coordinates and mutual-orthogonal axes. This paper first introduces the main viewpoint and basic content of the RSM, and then proposes a four-step method for designing the logical-level resource spaces: resource analysis, top-down resource partition, design two-dimensional resource spaces, and join between resource spaces. Design strategies and tools include: reference model, analogy and abstraction strategy, resource dictionary, independency checking tool, and orthogonality checking tool. The study on using the RSM to manage relational tables shows that the RSM is also suitable for managing structured resources. Applications show that the RSM together with the proposed development method is an applicable solution to realize normal and effective management of versatile web resources. Comparisons show the differences between the proposed model and the relational data model.

2. **Resource Space Model, OWL and Database: Mapping and Integration**

    Abstract: Semantics exhibits diversity in the real world, mental abstraction world, document world, and machine world. Studying mappings between different forms of semantics helps unveil the uniformity in the diversity. This article investigates the mappings between three typical semantic models: the Web ontology language (OWL), relational database model, and resource space model (a classiﬁcation-based semantic model). By establishing mappings between the semantic primitives of the three models, we study the mapping from OWL description onto resource space and analyze the normal forms of the generated resource space. Mapping back from resource space onto OWL description is then discussed. Further, we investigate the mapping between OWL description and relational database, as well as the mapping between relational database and resource space. Normal forms of the generated relational tables are analyzed. To support advanced applications on the future Web, we suggest integrating the resource space, OWL, and databases to form a powerful semantic platform that enables different semantic models to enhance each other.

3. **Probabilistic Resource Space Model for Managing Resources in Cyber-Physical Society**  

    Abstract: Classification is the most basic method for organizing resources in the physical space, cyber space, socio space, and mental space. To create a unified model that can effectively manage resources in different spaces is a challenge. The Resource Space Model RSM is to manage versatile resources with a multidimensional classification space. It supports generalization and specialization on multidimensional classifications. This paper introduces the basic concepts of RSM, and proposes the Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P-RSM, to deal with uncertainty in managing various resources in different spaces of the cyber-physical society. P-RSM’s normal forms, operations, and integrity constraints are developed to support effective management of the resource space. Characteristics of the P-RSM are analyzed through experiments. This model also enables various services to be described, discovered, and composed from multiple dimensions and abstraction levels with normal form and integrity guarantees. Some extensions and applications of the P-RSM are introduced.
